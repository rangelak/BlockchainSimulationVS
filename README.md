# Blockchain Simulator for VeriSign
*A secure platform for signing and storing documents on the blockchain with amendment functionality*

## Running
To run the code, clone the GitHub repository and run:

```
python simulation.py
```
## Testing for noise
To test for noise on the miners, uncomment the code in ```consensus.py```, and adjust the noise to the value that you're interested in (1 would mean that the miners report the wrong thing 100% of the time).
